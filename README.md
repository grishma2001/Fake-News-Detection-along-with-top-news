# Fake-News-Detection-along-with-top-news
The system will detect the news are real or fake. Along with it, it also provides top 5 related news from google. 
The system also consist of charts and graphs. The main motive of thi system is to detect the news from headlines and predict them either as fake or real using ML algorithm.
For getting top 5 headlines I have used GoogleNews API.
The kaggle link for dataset used in the system is https://www.kaggle.com/grishmamody/fake-news
In order to run the system , you need to run the app.py file.
